This library is an implementation of the [Python turtle library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) in C++ using [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2). I created this library so that people of all programming skill levels can create cool-looking graphics!

This library is great because:
- Is very easy to use
- Perfect for beginners to learn C++ syntax
- Is object-oriented
- Has 3 test examples that you can find [here](examples)
- Comes with great documentation
- Can produce rather complex graphics with a small amount of code

## Example usage
This is how you can draw a simple rectangle to the screen. This example can also be found [here](examples/rectangle).

```cpp
#include "src/tortoise.hpp"

#undef main // Fix errors

int main()
{
	tortoise tortoise{}; // Make tortoise object

	tortoise.init("rectangle", CENTERED, CENTERED, 640, 480); // Init the window

	tortoise.bgcolor(0, 0, 0, 255); // Change background color to black
	tortoise.pencolor(255, 255, 255, 255); // Change pen color to white

	// Draw a rectangle
	tortoise.up(50);
	tortoise.left(100);
	tortoise.down(50);
	tortoise.right(100);

	tortoise.present(); // Present the final image
	tortoise.delay(99999); // Don't close the window for 99999 ms

	return 0;
}
```
## How does it work?
This image shows perfectly how the code above functions and what result it creates.

To learn how to make more complex things like the logo, check out [this file](tests/tests.cpp). This code is what draws the logo right at the top of the README. Try it out for yourself!

## Dependencies
The only dependency of this library is SDL2.

To install it on Linux, use the package manager of your distro. For the Ubuntu package manager, you can paste the command below into the terminal.
```bash
# Install sdl2
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

To install it on Windows, if you are on **Windows 10 build 17063 or later**, you can **cd** into the wanted download directory and paste these commands.
```bash
# Download sdl2.zip
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f "https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.28.5/SDL2-devel-2.28.5-VC.zip" sdl2.zip
# Unzip sdl2.zip
tar -xf sdl2.zip
# Add sdl2 to your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable
setx CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH %cd%
```
## How do I get started?
If you are new, please check out the examples [here](examples).

After you do this:
- Install SDL2 dependency
- Download one of the examples
- Open up one of the examples using Visual Studio Community or any other Visual Studio version
- ***Don't open up the examples in any text editors like Vim or Visual Studio Code unless you are an advanced user!!***

## Documentation 
This library has a very well-written documentation. You can see the full documentation [here](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md). Alternatively, every function in this library has comments regarding its purpose, parameters, return types, etc.

## Issues and pull requests 
If you have any suggestions, ideas, or any sort of contribution, feel free to ask!
Please also open an issue if you have an issue (obviously).

Contribution guidelines can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
